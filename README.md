# Overview

As a software engineer continually seeking to enhance my expertise and understanding of modern programming languages, I embarked on a project to explore the capabilities of TypeScript. This project involves developing a simple note-taking application that offers both a command-line interface (CLI) and a web interface. The aim was to leverage TypeScript's strong typing and object-oriented features to create a robust application. This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of TypeScript syntax and its practical applications in real-world software development.

# Development Environment

This project was developed using Visual Studio Code, a versatile IDE that supports TypeScript out of the box. TypeScript, an extension of JavaScript, was the primary programming language used, enhanced with Node.js for the runtime environment. Libraries such as ts-node for executing TypeScript in a Node environment and Express for handling server-side logic in the web interface were also utilized.

# Future Work

- I can improve the dinamic of nesting notes to be more clear to the user
- Can also enhance the front end to a better user experience
